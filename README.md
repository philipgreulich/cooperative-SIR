This repository contains:
(1) a Wolfram Mathematica workbook to generate the solutions and Figures 2-6 of the work "Cooperative SIR dynamics as a model for spontaneous blood clot initiation". Running the workbook will generate the Figures in the home directory, other paths need to be manually specified. It requires MaTeX to be installed in order to display axes labels correctly.
